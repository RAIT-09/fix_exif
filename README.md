# fix_exif

A command line tool to modify datetime information in image files.

The datetime correction feature of services such as Google Photos, Amazon Photos, and Synology Photos does not edit Exif metadata, so the datetime will be lost when moving to other services.

By changing Exif metadata with this tool, you can eliminate differences in each service.

JPG and PNG are supported.
