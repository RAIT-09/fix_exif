# fix_exif

A command line tool to modify datetime information in image files.

The datetime correction feature of services such as Google Photos, Amazon Photos, and Synology Photos does not edit the Exif, so the datetime will be lost when the service is migrated.

By changing the Exif with this tool, you can eliminate differences in each service.

JPG and PNG are supported.
